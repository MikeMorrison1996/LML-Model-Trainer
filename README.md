## Project Overview

Our trading bot application aims to automate trading strategies by leveraging advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques. The application comprises several interconnected components:

1. **Market Data Collector**: Gathers real-time market data such as prices, volumes, and order books.
2. **LML-Model-Trainer**: Scrapes financial news headlines and trains a sentiment analysis model to interpret market sentiment.
3. **Strategy Engine**: Implements trading algorithms that utilize both market data and sentiment analysis to make informed decisions.
4. **Execution Module**: Executes trades on various exchanges or trading platforms.
5. **Monitoring & Logging**: Tracks performance metrics, logs activities, and provides alerts for critical events.

## LML-Model-Trainer Module

### Purpose

The **LML-Model-Trainer** module enhances our trading bot by:

- **Scraping Financial News**: Collecting the latest headlines from reputable financial news sources.
- **Training a Sentiment Analysis Model**: Utilizing BERT to understand and quantify the sentiment of news articles.
- **Providing Sentiment Scores**: Supplying real-time sentiment insights to the strategy engine for better trading decisions.

### Features

- **Data Scraping**:
  - **Multiple Sources**: Supports scraping from Yahoo Finance, Investing.com, and CoinGecko.
  - **Extensibility**: Easily add new sources with minimal code changes.
- **Model Training**:
  - **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust epochs, batch size, and learning rate through the interface.
  - **Advanced NLP Techniques**: Employs BERT for high-quality sentiment analysis.
- **Integration Interface**:
  - **Easy Integration**: Designed to plug into the trading bot with straightforward method calls.
  - **Real-Time Predictions**: Provides quick sentiment analysis for incoming news.

### Integration in the Trading Bot

- **Decision Enhancement**: Sentiment scores help the bot understand market mood, refining trade entries and exits.
- **Risk Management**: Detect negative sentiments that might affect asset prices, allowing preemptive actions.
- **Strategic Adaptability**: Enables the bot to adjust strategies based on evolving market sentiments.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.6 or higher**
- **pip** package manager
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)

### Required Packages

Install the necessary Python packages:

```bash
pip install torch transformers requests beautifulsoup4 scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Usage

### Integration Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/LML-Model-Trainer.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Module Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd LML-Model-Trainer
   ```

3. **Include the Module in Your Trading Bot**:

   Copy or link the `lml_model_trainer.py` file into your trading bot's project directory.

4. **Import the Module**:

   ```python
   from lml_model_trainer import LMLModelTrainer
   ```

5. **Initialize the Trainer**:

   ```python
   trainer = LMLModelTrainer()
   ```

6. **Set Training Parameters** (Optional):

   ```python
   trainer.set_parameters(num_epochs=10, batch_size=8, learning_rate=0.001)
   ```

7. **Select Data Sources**:

   ```python
   trainer.select_sources(['Yahoo Finance', 'Investing.com', 'CoinGecko'])
   ```

8. **Train the Model**:

   ```python
   trainer.train_model()
   ```

9. **Use the Sentiment Analysis in Your Strategy**:

   ```python
   headline = "Global markets soar as economic outlook improves"
   sentiment_score = trainer.predict_sentiment(headline)
   # Incorporate sentiment_score into your trading logic
   ```

### Example Code

```python
# In your trading bot's main script

from lml_model_trainer import LMLModelTrainer

# Initialize the sentiment trainer
trainer = LMLModelTrainer()

# Set training parameters if desired
trainer.set_parameters(num_epochs=5, batch_size=16, learning_rate=2e-5)

# Select data sources for scraping
trainer.select_sources(['Yahoo Finance', 'CoinGecko'])

# Train the sentiment model
trainer.train_model()

# During trading operations
latest_headline = "Tech stocks decline amid regulatory concerns"
sentiment = trainer.predict_sentiment(latest_headline)

# Use the sentiment score in your trading strategy
if sentiment > 0.7:
    # Strong positive sentiment
    execute_trade('buy', amount)
elif sentiment < 0.3:
    # Strong negative sentiment
    execute_trade('sell', amount)
else:
    # Neutral sentiment
    hold_position()
```

## Future Plans

- **Enhanced Labeling Mechanism**: Implement a more accurate labeling system, possibly through semi-supervised learning or sentiment APIs.
- **Additional Data Sources**: Integrate more diverse news outlets and social media feeds.
- **Model Improvements**: Experiment with different models (e.g., RoBERTa, XLNet) for potentially better performance.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Enable continuous training with new data for an always up-to-date sentiment model.
- **Automated Hyperparameter Tuning**: Implement methods to automatically find the best training parameters.
